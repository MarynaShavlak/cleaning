## :computer: Technologies Used

Cleaning Website is built using a variety of technologies to ensure a seamless
user experience:

1. HTML5 and CSS3 are used to create a clean and user-friendly interface that is
   easy to navigate.
2. JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, allowing you to set reminders
   on the cleaning scheduler and engage with the Q&A section.
3. Responsive Design ensures that Cleaning Website is accessible and functional
   on a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

- **HTML5** is used to structure the project interface, organizing content and
  interactive elements for a solid user interface foundation.
- **SCSS/SASS** is responsible for styling and enhancing the project visually,
  with custom styles, animations, and responsive design techniques that ensure a
  visually appealing and consistent user experience across different devices.
  - **CSS Grid Layout** was instrumental in creating an innovative and
    aesthetically engaging layout for the reviews section. In this design, the
    placement of reviews transcends conventional column and row arrangements,
    adapting to the varying heights of individual blocks. It adds a distinctive
    and visually appealing dimension to the section, enhancing its overall
    appeal and user experience.
- **JavaScript** powers every aspect of this project for a smooth user
  experience. It handles the aside menu, room slider with tooltips, FAQ
  accordion, modals, form data collection with error checking, custom calendar
  and time picker, Google Maps location selection, item selection and quality
  adjustment, and calculates the total cost of each user's cleaning order.
- The **BEM methodology** organizes the codebase, making it more maintainable
  and scalable by breaking down components into reusable building blocks. It
  enhances code understanding, facilitates collaboration, and reduces
  duplication.
- **Git and GitHub** are used for version control, enabling efficient
  collaboration, code sharing, and tracking of modifications. GitHub serves as a
  centralized repository for storing the codebase, facilitating version control,
  issue tracking, and collaboration among developers.
- **Responsive design** ensures that the game adapts to different screen sizes
  and devices. By utilizing CSS media queries and flexible layouts, it provides
  an optimal user experience across various platforms, enhancing accessibility,
  satisfaction, and engagement.
